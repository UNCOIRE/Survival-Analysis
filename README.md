Resources for the Survival Analysis poster at AIR 2024

Scenario: You have been asked to determine the the potential effects of student attributes on the time to degree/likelihood of graduating in a master's program at your institution. Some of the variables are constant throughout the student's duration in the master's program (ex: gender, whether they participated in a pre-enrollment coaching program) while others vary across terms (ex: student's employment status, credits attempted per term). The 'Masters Time to Degree.xlsx' file has the student information and is already formatted for use in the survival analysis and the 'Data Dictionary' provides explanations of the variables including the meaning behind the coding. Use the 'Masters Time to Degree Survival Analysis.R' to run the analysis.

The data in the student file has been simulated and does not describe any real students, living or dead. This means that the diagnistics in this example are much cleaner than what you will likely experience in your own data. Here are helpful resources for the challenges you may encounter when modeling discrete time survival analysis with your own data :
